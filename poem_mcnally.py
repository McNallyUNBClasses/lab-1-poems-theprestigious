print("Prof. McNally and the Pythonic Way")

print("In the land of loops and logic gates,")
print("Where bugs and errors seal our fates,")
print("Lives Prof. McNally, wise and spry,")
print("With Python code and coffee nigh.")


print("His glasses perched, a thoughtful stare,")
print("He sips his mug in classroom air.")
print("He doesn't just teach 'syntax, son'—")
print("He teaches how the job is done.")

print("Step one, he says, now gather round—")
print("Read the question! Break it down!")  
print("Step two: Reduce it to the core,")
print("No clutter, fluff, or mental war.")


print("Step three: Rewrite with your own flair,")
print("So logic fits and answers pair.")
print("Now test by hand, he gives a grin,")
print("If humans fail, computers won't win!")

print("Step five is a gem—define that plan,")
print("Your algorithm, like a map for man. ")
print("Then test again, no need to code,")
print("Til logic walks a perfect road.")
print("Step seven! he beams, You may proceed—")
print("Turn on the computer, fulfill your need!")

print("Then with a spark in eye so bright,")
print("He says, Now program—make it right.")
print("He says, “Now program—make it right.”")
print("Step nine, he warns, you're not yet done,")
print("Try known test cases, every one!")

print("Then finally, unknowns must fall—")
print("The true test case! The coder's brawl!") 
print("“Then finally, unknowns must fall—")
print("The true test case! The coder's brawl!”")

print("And through it all, his heart is warmed")
print("By thoughts of wife and daughter charmed.")
print("He writes, he tests, he caffeinates,")
print("And laughs when Python complicates.")
print("So here's to the prof who teaches more")
print("Than print() and what a loop is for—")

print("He trains the mind to see and strive,")
print("With ten fine steps... and coffee to survive!")
